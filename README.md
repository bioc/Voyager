This package brings the tradition of geospatial statistics to spatial omics by wrapping classical geospatial packages such as `spdep` and `adespatial` to be used with the SpatialFeatureExperiment class, which extends SpatialExperiment with sf.

The [companion website](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/) for this package includes vignettes that showcase the functionality of `Voyager` in the context of the Visium, Slide-seq V2, CosMx, Xenium, and MERFISH technologies.  
## Installation

This package is in Bioconductor version 3.16 and above. Install with

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager")) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.16") # Or a higher version in the future
BiocManager::install("Voyager")
```

The main branch in this repo is the release version. The development version of Voyager can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pachterlab/voyager", ref = "devel")
```

Or from Bioconductor with:

```r
BiocManager::install("Voyager", version = "devel")
```
